Event Management API
# EventFlow - Event Management API

This repository contains the source code for a robust and scalable Event Management API. It provides a comprehensive solution for creating, managing, and interacting with events, including features for user registration, venue management, and details about speakers and sponsors.
Key Features

## üöÄ Getting Started

Technologies
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

    Backend: [Backend Language/Framework, Python with Django/Flask]
### Prerequisites

    Database: [PostgreSQL, MySQL]
*   Python 3.8+
*   PostgreSQL or another database system
*   Redis (for Celery)
*   Git

    API Documentation: [Swagger/OpenAPI]
### 1. Clone the Repository

    Authentication: [JWT, OAuth 2.0]
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Damilola640/Event_Management_API.git
cd Event_Management_API/event_planner
```

API Endpoints
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

The API is built around a RESTful architecture and provides the following key endpoints:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Endpoint
	
```bash
# For Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Description
+# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

POST /api/auth/register
	
### 3. Install Dependencies

Creates a new user account.
Install all the required packages from `requirements.txt`.

POST /api/auth/login
	
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Authenticates a user and returns a token.
### 4. Configure Environment Variables

GET /api/events
	
Create a `.env` file in the `event_planner` directory (where `manage.py` is located). Copy the contents of `.env.example` into it and fill in the values.

Retrieves a list of all events.
**.env.example:**
```ini
SECRET_KEY='your-strong-secret-key'
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost

POST /api/events
	
# Use PostgreSQL in production
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3

Creates a new event.
# Celery and Redis
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/0

GET /api/events/{id}
	
# Email settings (using MailHog/console for development)
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
# EMAIL_HOST=localhost
# EMAIL_PORT=1025
# EMAIL_HOST_USER=
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@eventflow.com
```

Retrieves details for a specific event.
### 5. Run Database Migrations

PUT /api/events/{id}
	
Apply the database migrations to create the database schema.

Updates an existing event.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

DELETE /api/events/{id}
	
### 6. Create a Superuser

Deletes an event.
Create an admin user to access the Django admin panel.

POST /api/events/{id}/register
	
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Registers the authenticated user for an event.
### 7. Run the Development Server

GET /api/users/{id}/registrations
	
Start the Django development server.

Retrieves all registrations for a user.
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

GET /api/venues
	
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

Retrieves a list of venues.
### 8. Run the Celery Worker

GET /api/speakers
	
To process background tasks like sending emails, you need to run a Celery worker in a separate terminal.

Retrieves a list of speakers.
```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
celery -A EventFlow worker -l info
```

GET /api/sponsors
	
## üìñ API Documentation

Retrieves a list of sponsors.
